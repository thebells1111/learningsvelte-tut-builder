      "text": "---\r\ntitle: Styling-c\r\ncomponent: Display.svelte\r\n---\r\n\r\nFirst, let's style the buttons some. We'll add a button selector in our `style` tag.\r\n\r\n```css\r\nbutton {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'll want the cursor to be a pointer when we hover over it, so we'll set `cursor: pointer`.\r\n\r\n```css\r\nbutton {\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe margins from a global button style are making it look off, so let's reset our margins and padding.\r\n\r\n```css\r\nbutton {\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n  padding: 0;\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe numbers aren't popping enough, so let's make them a little bigger, a little bolder, and give them some border styling.\r\n\r\n```css\r\nbutton {\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n  padding: 0;\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n  font-size: 1.2em;\r\n  font-weight: 700;\r\n  border-style: outset;\r\n  border-radius: 3px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the buttons look too short, so let's give them a height.\r\n\r\n```css\r\nbutton {\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n  padding: 0;\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n  font-size: 1.2em;\r\n  font-weight: 700;\r\n  border-style: outset;\r\n  border-radius: 3px;\r\n  height: 2.1em;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, let's space those buttons out a little from each other.\r\n\r\n```css\r\nbutton {\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n  padding: 0;\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n  font-size: 1.2em;\r\n  font-weight: 700;\r\n  border-style: outset;\r\n  border-radius: 3px;\r\n  height: 2.1em;\r\n  margin: 1px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOk, our buttons are looking better, but we need to move them around a little look more like a calculator.\r\n\r\nStarting with the `AC` and `C` buttons, we'll tell them to span 2 columns. Since the fCC story had us assign an `id` to each element, we'll use the `id` css selector to style each button. So, in the `style` tag, add this css.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#ac {\r\n  grid-column: span 2;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#clear {\r\n  grid-column: span 2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's have the `+` button span two rows.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#add {\r\n  grid-row: span 2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWait a minute, why isn't it spanning the two rows like we want. It is, but the css for `button` is setting the `height` to `2.1em`. We'll have to override that.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#add {\r\n  grid-row: span 2;\r\n  height: initial;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOkay, and we'll expand the `=` button to take up two rows.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#equal {\r\n  grid-row: span 2;\r\n  height: initial;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have an open spot on the last row, third column, which we can fill up by telling the `0` to span two rows.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#zero {\r\n  grid-column: span 2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now, the calculator width is set to 100% of its parent.\r\nNext up, we'll create a prop we can pass to the calculator that let's us set the width of the calculator component.\r\n",

      "text": "---\r\ntitle: Styling-b\r\ncomponent: Display.svelte\r\n---\r\n\r\nNow, to further refine this, lets adjust our grids.\r\n\r\nIn our `Display.svelte` componenent, inside of our `style` tag, we'll add some more `css`.\r\n\r\nWe'll start with the display at the top of the calculator. Since we were required to give it an id by the fCC user story, we'll access it with the id selector.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#display {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, let's tell it to start in the first column and span 4 columns, so it will take up the whole width of the first row.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#display {\r\n  grid-column: 1 / span 4;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOk, looking a little better. Let's add some more styling so the display stand out a little better.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#display {\r\n  grid-column: 1 / span 4;\r\n  border: solid 1px black;\r\n  background-color: #ddd;\r\n  border-radius: 2px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's a little too short, so let's give it a height of 60px.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#display {\r\n  grid-column: 1 / span 4;\r\n  border: solid 1px black;\r\n  background-color: #ddd;\r\n  border-radius: 2px;\r\n  height: 60px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'll gussy this thing up a little with some linear-gradient to make the display look like it has a little reflection.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#display {\r\n  grid-column: 1 / span 4;\r\n  border: solid 1px black;\r\n  background-color: #ddd;\r\n  border-radius: 2px;\r\n  height: 60px;\r\n  background: linear-gradient(\r\n    135deg,\r\n    #fefefe 0%,\r\n    #d1d1d1 37%,\r\n    #dbdbdb 58%,\r\n    #e2e2e2 100%\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOooh, that's nice...\r\n\r\nWe'll add some margin on the bottom to separate the buttons from the screen.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#display {\r\n  grid-column: 1 / span 4;\r\n  border: solid 1px black;\r\n  background-color: #ddd;\r\n  border-radius: 2px;\r\n  height: 60px;\r\n  background: linear-gradient(\r\n    135deg,\r\n    #fefefe 0%,\r\n    #d1d1d1 37%,\r\n    #dbdbdb 58%,\r\n    #e2e2e2 100%\r\n  );\r\n  margin-bottom: 2.5px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd because the display isn't a button, let's ensure there isn't the hand when we hover over it by setting `cursor: default`.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#display {\r\n  grid-column: 1 / span 4;\r\n  border: solid 1px black;\r\n  background-color: #ddd;\r\n  border-radius: 2px;\r\n  height: 60px;\r\n  background: linear-gradient(\r\n    135deg,\r\n    #fefefe 0%,\r\n    #d1d1d1 37%,\r\n    #dbdbdb 58%,\r\n    #e2e2e2 100%\r\n  );\r\n  margin-bottom: 2.5px;\r\n  cursor: default;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGreat, now that is some display. But... our buttons are kind of wonky, so let's fix that.\r\n",

      "text": "---\r\ntitle: Styling-a\r\ncomponent: Display.svelte\r\n---\r\n\r\nOkay, let's start styling this guy.\r\n\r\nUnderneath the `script` tag, create a new `style` tag. It'll look like\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style></style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nInside of that that tag, create a style for the `.calculator` class.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style>\r\n  .calculator {\r\n  }\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we can start styling.\r\n\r\nWe don't want the user to be able to highlight things, so we'll set `user-select: none`. We'll make the cursor into a pointer so it looks like a hand, which seems appropriate for a calculator app. `cursor: pointer`. And let's make the background sort of grayish, so `background-color: #bbb`, and the text to be darker gray so `color: #444`\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.calculator {\r\n  user-select: none;\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n  color: #444;\r\n  background-color: #bbb;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, a calculator is laid out in a grid, so `css grid` will serve us well. Let's set the display to grid by typing in `display: grid`\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.calculator {\r\n  user-select: none;\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n  color: #444;\r\n  background-color: #bbb;\r\n  display: grid;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd we'll split the calculator into four columns, so we'll let's add `grid-template-columns: 25% 25% 25% 25%`.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.calculator {\r\n  user-select: none;\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n  color: #444;\r\n  background-color: #bbb;\r\n  display: grid;\r\n  grid-template-columns: 25% 25% 25% 25%;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd we'll refine the style a little by giving the calculator a solid black border and some padding.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.calculator {\r\n  user-select: none;\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n  color: #444;\r\n  background-color: #bbb;\r\n  display: grid;\r\n  grid-template-columns: 25% 25% 25% 25%;\r\n  border: solid 1px black;\r\n  padding: 5px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlright, it's starting to look more like a calculator already.\r\n",

(decimal point) symbol with a corresponding id=\"decimal\".~~\r\n\r\n~~**User Story #5:** My calculator should contain a clickable element with an id=\"clear\".~~\r\n\r\n~~**User Story #6:** My calculator should contain an element to display values with a corresponding id=\"display\".~~\r\n\r\n**User Story #7:** At any time, pressing the clear button clears the input and output values, and returns the calculator to its initialized state; 0 should be shown in the element with the id of display.\r\n\r\n**User Story #8:** As I input numbers, I should be able to see my input in the element with the id of display.\r\n\r\n**User Story #9:** In any order, I should be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide a chain of numbers of any length, and when I hit =, the correct result should be shown in the element with the id of display.\r\n\r\n**User Story #10**: When inputting numbers, my calculator should not allow a number to begin with multiple zeros.\r\n\r\n**User Story #11**: When the decimal element is clicked, a . should append to the currently displayed value; two . in one number should not be accepted.\r\n\r\n**User Story #12**: I should be able to perform any operation (+, -, \\*, /) on numbers containing decimal points.\r\n\r\n**User Story #13**: If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered (excluding the negative (-) sign). For example, if 5 + _ 7 = is entered, the result should be 35 (i.e. 5 _ 7); if 5 \\* - 5 = is entered, the result should be -25 (i.e. 5 x (-5)).\r\n\r\n**User Story #14**: Pressing an operator immediately following = should start a new calculation that operates on the result of the previous evaluation.\r\n\r\n**User Story #15**: My calculator should have several decimal places of precision when it comes to rounding (note that there is no exact standard, but you should be able to handle calculations like 2 / 7 with reasonable precision to at least 4 decimal places).\r\n",

      "text": "---\r\ntitle: Create Display\r\n---\r\n\r\nLet's make a new component and call it `Display.svelte` by clicking on the `+` sign in the REPL.\r\n\r\nInside of our `Display.svelte` file, we'll create a script tag and set it up for the props from the Calculator.svelte component by using `export let variableName`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<script>\r\n  export let total = 0; export let totalArr = []; export let buttons = [];\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is Sveltes method of passing props. Any child component will need export in front of the variable declaration in order to receive the prop from it's parent.\r\n\r\nWe'll also setup the HTML to display the calculator.\r\n\r\nBelow your script tag, create a `div` elements with a `class` of `calculator`.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"calculator\"> </div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nInside that `div`, create another `div` with an `id` of `display`.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"calculator\">\r\n  <div id=\"display\"> </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause we'll want to keep track of our inputted values, as well as our running total, we'll also create two more divs inside the `#display` div. For styling purposes later, let's give the first one a `class` of `display-top` and the second one a `class` of `display-bottom`\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"calculator\">\r\n  <div id=\"display\">\r\n    <div class=\"display-top\">{totalArr}</div>\r\n    <div class=\"display-bottom\">{total}</div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce we have that done, let's create each of our buttons. To do that, we'll use a `#each` loop. Svelte has a built in function that will loop through an array and use the value of each array index. The format will look like this.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n{#each buttons as button}\r\n<button id=\"{button.id}\" on:click=\"{button.func}\">\r\n  {button.value}\r\n</button>\r\n{/each}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function is opened with `{#each}`, then the array we're looping through is declared `{#each buttons}`, then each indexed value will be used `{#each buttons as button}`.\r\n\r\nNow we can create an HTML template that will be repeated for each array index.\r\n\r\nOurs will create a series of buttons from the `buttons` variable, which is an array containing objects, each of which has an `id` key, a `func` key, and a `value` key.\r\n\r\nSvelte also allows event binding by using `on:click=\"{functionToBeCalled}\"`.\r\nWhenever Svelte encounters the handlebars in the HTML, it will use the JS variable within the handlbars. There are several other event handlers one can use with `on:`, such as `on:focus`, `on:blur`, `on:change`, and several others that will come up in other tutorials.\r\n\r\nOur final HTML should look like this.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"calculator\">\r\n  <div id=\"display\">\r\n    <div class=\"display-top\">{totalArr}</div>\r\n    <div class=\"display-bottom\">{total}</div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  {#each buttons as button}\r\n  <button id=\"{button.id}\" on:click=\"{button.func}\">\r\n    {button.value}\r\n  </button>\r\n  {/each}\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat we have here is a main div with the class=\"calculator\". Inside of that div with an id=\"display for displaying the calculator output. Finally, we have a Svelte {#each} loop that will take the value of each item in the buttons array, and loop through it creating the HTML for each button, which will consist of the id of the button(which we're providing for the freeCodeCamp project), the on:click handler to call a function when the button is clicked, and the display value of the button.\r\n\r\nIn our App.svelte, inside of our `script` tag, let's add the following. This allows us to use the Display component inside of our App.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<script>\r\n  import Display from './Display.svelte' let total = 0; let totalArr = []; ...\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the Display Component import, we can add it to our HTML. Since it's the only thing we have for HTML, we'll put it at the bottom, below our script tag.\r\n\r\nIf you click on the arrow next to the `<script>`, you'll fold the whole script tag, then you can enter your `Display` component in the HTML section.\r\n\r\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\r\n```html\r\n<script>...</script>\r\n\r\n<Display \r\n  {total} \r\n  {buttons} \r\n  {totalArr} \r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe curly braces around each of the variables is how we pass props from the parent down to the child. Another way to pass the prop would be something like\r\n\r\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\r\n```html\r\n<Display \r\n  total=\"{total}\" \r\n  buttons=\"{buttons}\" \r\n  totalArr=\"{totalArr}\" \r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe value not in curly braces is the name of the prop being sent to the child component, and would also be the name of the variable in the child component with `export` in front of it. The value in the curly braces is the variable from the parent being sent to the child. If the prop name and the parent variable name are the same, Svelte allows putting the name in curly braces as a short hand method. So. `{total}` is equivalent to `total={total}`\r\n\r\nTry changing the `total` variable in `App.svelte` to `foo`. In order to pass it to `Display`, you'll need to change\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<Display {total} {buttons} {totalArr} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<Display total=\"{foo}\" {buttons} {totalArr} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn `Display.svelte`, change `export let total = 0` to `export let bar = 100`. This will set the variable bar with an initial value of 100. Then change\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"display-bottom\">{total}</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nin your HTML to\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"display-bottom\">{bar}</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand you should see 100 displayed in the results.\r\n\r\nNow go back to `App.svelte` and change\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<Display total=\"{foo}\" {buttons} {totalArr} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<Display bar=\"{foo}\" {buttons} {totalArr} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see 0 displayed in the results now, because the variable `bar` in `Display.svelte` gets it's data from `foo` in `App.svelte`. If you change the `foo` variable to 1000 in `App.svelte`, you'll see it updated in the results.\r\n\r\nFinally, change\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<Display bar=\"{foo}\" {buttons} {totalArr} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nback to\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<Display {total} {buttons} {totalArr} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nor click the `Auto Complete Code` button to restore our App to it's current state.\r\n\r\nWithout any styling, the calculator will look and act like this. You can click on the buttons and check the console.log to verify your button is working.\r\n\r\nYou may notice the buttons are in a seemingly random order. This is because we're going to lay the calculator out using CSS Grid later, using a four column layout, and the buttons in this order will fall into the places we need them for the layout.\r\n",

For example, if 5 + _ 7 = is entered, the result should be 35 (i.e. 5 _ 7); if 5 \\* - 5 = is entered, the result should be -25 (i.e. 5 x (-5)).\r\n\r\n**User Story #14**: Pressing an operator immediately following = should start a new calculation that operates on the result of the previous evaluation.\r\n\r\n**User Story #15**: My calculator should have several decimal places of precision when it comes to rounding (note that there is no exact standard, but you should be able to handle calculations like 2 / 7 with reasonable precision to at least 4 decimal places).\r\n\r\n**Note On Calculator Logic:** It should be noted that there are two main schools of thought on calculator input logic: immediate execution logic and formula logic. Our example utilizes formula logic and observes order of operation precedence, immediate execution does not. Either is acceptable, but please note that depending on which you choose, your calculator may yield different results than ours for certain equations (see below example). As long as your math can be verified by another production calculator, please do not consider this a bug.\r\n\r\n**EXAMPLE:** 3 + 5 x 6 - 2 / 4 =\r\n\r\n**Immediate Execution Logic:** 11.5\r\n\r\n**Formula/Expression Logic**: 32.5\r\n\r\nWe will be doing Immediate Execution as that is how most simple calculators operate.\r\n",

      "text": "---\r\ntitle: Let's style!!\r\n---\r\nWe know the test are working, so let's remove that from our code. In `App.svelte`, go ahead and remove the whole `svelte:head` tag. \r\n\r\nWe'll also make the styling on this super simple. You can make it whatever you want, because the style is for the most part independent of the functionality. There will be one extra prop we'll have to pass to make the style work with the key press, but we'll get to that in a minute. \r\n\r\nTo start, we'll put all of the pads in a grid.\r\n\r\nInside of `App.svelte`, create a `<style>` tag below the script tag. Inside of that tag, type the following:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style>\r\n  .drum-pads {\r\n    display: grid;\r\n    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);\r\n    width: 320px;\r\n    height: 320px;\r\n    border: 1px solid black;\t\t\r\n    box-sizing: border-box;\r\n  }\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will put of the pads in a 3x3 grid, set the over all width and height to a fixed height, then add a border around the whole div. The box-sizing we'll keep everything contained inside of the `320px` with set in the height and width. \r\n\r\nIt still looks kind of goofy, so we'll also style each of the individual buttons. Inside the `Drumpad.svelte` component, add a `style` tag. Inside of that tag add the following:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style>\r\n\tbutton {\r\n\t\t\twidth: 100%;\r\n\t\t\theight: 100%;  \r\n\t\t\tborder: solid black 2px;  \r\n\t\t}\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOkay, that looks better. We'll come back to it, but for now, there's that annoying jump whenever the display shows. Let's change that.\r\n\r\nInside of the 'Display.svelte' component, create a 'style' tag and add this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style>\r\n\tp {\r\n    width: 320px;\r\n    height: 40px;\r\n    border: 3px solid black;\r\n  }\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo that gets rid of the annoying jump, but it still looks incomplete. Let's remove the margin, the thick bottom line that comes from removing the margin, and change the width to match the width of the drumpads.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style>\r\n\tp {\r\n    width: 320px;\r\n    height: 40px;\r\n    border: 3px solid black;\r\n\t\tmargin: 0;\r\n\t\tborder-bottom: none;\r\n    box-sizing: border-box;\r\n  }\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can now center everything by using the cool new `CSS grid` styles, then thicken up the text some with `font-weight`.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style>\r\n\tp {\r\n    width: 320px;\r\n    height: 40px;\r\n    border: 3px solid black;\r\n\t\tmargin: 0;\r\n\t\tborder-bottom: none;\r\n    box-sizing: border-box;\r\n\t\tdisplay: grid;\r\n  \tplace-items: center center;\r\n\t\tfont-weight: 700;\r\n  }\r\n</style>\r\n\r\nThe `display` is looking good, so let's polish up the buttons and finish this project. \r\n\r\nBack in 'Drumpad.svelte', go back to the `button` styles, and let's change that background color. Let's also get rid of the annoying little dots at the intersection of each button border, which is caused by the radius of each button. We'll also thicken up the text here with `font-weight`.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style>\r\n\tbutton {\r\n\t\t\twidth: 100%;\r\n\t\t\theight: 100%;  \r\n\t\t\tborder: solid black 2px; \t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tbackground-color: white;\r\n\t\t\tborder-radius: 0; \r\n    \tfont-weight: 700;\r\n\t\t}\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's working, but it turns gray when the button is clicked. Let's make it turn black with white text.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style>\r\n\tbutton {\r\n\t\t\twidth: 100%;\r\n\t\t\theight: 100%;  \r\n\t\t\tborder: solid black 2px; \t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tbackground-color: white;\r\n\t\t\tborder-radius: 0; \r\n    \tfont-weight: 700;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\r\n  button:active {\r\n    background-color: black;\r\n    color: white;\r\n  }\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe are just about wrapped up. However, there is one little design tweak that would make this even better. Notice when you hit the key on your keyboard that the button doesn't change color the same way it does when you click the button with your mouse. Let's do something about that. Down in your `button` tag in the markup, add `class:active={key === pad.id}`. \r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button\r\n    id={pad.displayText}\r\n    class=\"drum-pad\"\r\n    on:click={() => playSound(pad)}\r\n    class:active={key === pad.id}\r\n\t>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will add a class of active to the button if the `key` prop is equal to the `pad.id`. Now, we don't have a key prop, so go back to your script and add `export let key`.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  export let pad;\r\n  export let playSound;\r\n  export let key;\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, go back to the styles and add the `active` class to the `button:active` styles.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.active,\r\n  button:active {\r\n    background-color: black;\r\n    color: white;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, go to `App.svelte`, and create a new variable called `key`.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  import Drumpad from './Drumpad.svelte';\r\n  import Display from './Display.svelte';\r\n  let displayText = '';\r\n  let key;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause we did that, we can now go into the `handleKeyDown` function, and remove the `const` from `const key = e.key.toUpperCase();`. Now, whenever the key is pressed, it will change the global `key` variable. \r\n\r\nOn last problem though. Now, whenever the key is pressed, it changes color, but it stays that color even after the key is released. We need a way to reset the `key` variable whenever the key is released. Super easy.\r\n\r\nGo down to the `svelte:window` tag, and add `on:keyup={() => (key = '')}` below the `on:keydown` event binder. This just calls an annonymous function to set the key to a empty string whenever the key is released. \r\n\r\n```html\r\n<svelte:window\r\n  on:keydown={handleKeydown}\r\n  on:keyup={() => (key = '')}\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow clicking the key on the keyboard works as expected. Awesome!!! You just completed building a Drum Machine with Svelte. Now go build other cool things!!!\r\n",

      "text": "---\r\ntitle: Adding Display\r\n---\r\nThe last thing we'll need to do to complete our functionality is add our display and contain everything in a Drum Machine container. This will complete User Stories #1, #2 and #7.\r\n\r\n**User Story #1:** I should be able to see an outer container with a corresponding id=\"drum-machine\" that contains all other elements.\r\n\r\n**User Story #2:** Within #drum-machine I can see an element with a corresponding id=\"display\".\r\n\r\n**User Story #7:** When a .drum-pad is triggered, a string describing the associated audio clip is displayed as the inner text of the #display element (each string must be unique).\r\n\r\nTo start, click on the `+` tab in the REPL, and name the new file `Display.svelte`.\r\n\r\nInside of `Display.svelte`, add the following:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  export let displayText;\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"display\">{displayText}</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will setup this component to receive the `displayText` prop and display it in the `p` tag. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInside of `App.svelte`, `import Display from './Display.svelte'` and create a new variable `let displayText = ''`.\r\n\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  import Drumpad from './Drumpad.svelte';\r\n  import Display from './Display.svelte';\r\n\r\n  let displayText = '';\r\n  const drumPads = [...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, in the markup, add the `Display` component with the the `displayText` prop passed. Then wrap everything in a `div` with an id of `drum-machine`.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<svelte:window on:keydown={handleKeydown} />\r\n<div id=\"drum-machine\">\r\n  <Display {displayText} />\r\n  <div class=\"drum-pads\">\r\n    {#each drumPads as pad, index}\r\n      <Drumpad {pad} {playSound} />\r\n    {/each}\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'll need a way to update `displayText` whenever a sound is played. Since we already have a `playSound` function, we can easily change `displayText`. Since the `pad` object is sent to the `playSound` function as an argument, we have access to the `pad.displayText` for every `pad`. We simply have to set `1`displayText = pad.displayText` anytime the function is called.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n function playSound(pad) {\r\n    const sound = pad.audioElement;\r\n    sound.currentTime = 0;\r\n    sound.play();\r\n\t\tdisplayText = pad.displayText;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, we can hit our button, or key, and the display should show the sound played.\r\n\r\nIt seems like we've now accomplished all of the user stories, so let's bring in the fCC test to see if we've passed them all.\r\n\r\nWe'll use the `svelte:head` tag to add some things to the header of this particular page. We'll be adding a script reference to the fCC test. In your markup, add the following at the top above `svelte:window`\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<svelte:head>\r\n  <script\r\n    src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js\">\r\n\r\n  </script>\r\n</svelte:head>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSelect Drum Machine from the Test Suite, and run the test!\r\n\r\nHmm... we passed 7/8. \r\n\r\nWhen we click `Tests` button again, it brings up an error on User Story #7. Let's look at that one again.\r\n\r\n**User Story #7:** When a .drum-pad is triggered, a string describing the associated audio clip is displayed as the inner text of the #display element (each string must be unique).\r\n\r\nOk, but that's happening when we trigger a pad. What's up with that? It must be something related to fCC's test program. Let's see if we can create a work around. It mentions inner text.  We can use our `document.getElementById('display')` to access the innerText of our display element. Let's try that. \r\n\r\nInside of the `playSound` function replace `displayText = pad.displayText` with \r\n`document.getElementById('display').innerText = pad.displayText`. It's not quite as elegant, but it is cool that Svelte allows us to use vanilla JS with no problems. Rerun the test, and we get 8/8. Awesome!!! We're complete with the task.\r\n\r\nBut, it does look ugly, so let's add a little bit of styling, and change the behavior a little so the display only shows the sound as long as the sound is playing. Let's do the sound real quick, then move on to styling. \r\n\r\nInside of `playSound`, we have access to each `audioElement` through the `pad` argument. Because it's a reference to an audio tag, we also have access to the duration of each clip. Audio duration is returned in seconds, so we can convert that to milliseconds by multiplying by 1000, then set a timeout to clear the `document.getElementById('display').innerText` string whenever the clip is complete or updated. Normally we would update the `displayText` varibable, but we have to do it this way because of our work around. \r\n\r\nUpdate the `playSound` function to look like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction playSound(pad) {\r\n\tconst sound = pad.audioElement;\r\n\tsound.currentTime = 0;\r\n\tsound.play();\r\n\tdocument.getElementById('display').innerText = pad.displayText;\r\n\r\n\tsetTimeout(\r\n\t\t() => (document.getElementById('display').innerText = ''),\r\n\t\tsound.duration * 1000\r\n\t);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow play around with the sounds, and notice how the `display` disappears when the audio clip is done.\r\n\r\nRun the test, and everything is still passing. It looks like we're good to go.\r\n\r\nOn to styling.",

      "text": "---\r\ntitle: Create Trigger Keys\r\n---\r\nOkay, now it's time to add our trigger keys so we can complete User Story #6. This will be super easy. Thanks Svelte!!!\r\n\r\nSvelte has a way for us to add event listeners to the global window object, which is conveniently called `<svelte:window>`\r\n\r\nInside of `App.svelte`, in the markup, add `<svelte:window on:keydown={handleKeydown} />` above the `each` loop.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<svelte:window on:keydown={handleKeydown} />\r\n\r\n{#each drumPads as pad}\r\n  <Drumpad {pad} {playSound} />\r\n{/each}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will attach a `keydown` event listener to the global window object, that whenever triggered will call the `handleKeydown` function. We could call the function whatever we want, but we'll settle for `handleKeydown`.\r\n\r\nLet's create the `handleKeydown` function now. Inside of the `script` tag, under the `playSound` function create the `handleKeydown` function.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction handleKeydown(e) {\r\n\tconst key = e.key.toUpperCase()\r\n\tconsole.log(key)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, start pressing keys, and you'll see in your `console.log` which key you were pressing. We're converting it to upper case so the key will work regardless of caps lock or shift. Ok, but we're only interested in a limited subset of the keys. How can we ensure the key we're pressing falls within that subset. We'll create an array of our subset, then use `indexOf` to see if the key we pressed falls in that subset. We'll put the letters in the same order as the letters in the `drumPads` array created earlier, so we can use the index number returned from `indexOf` to send the proper `drumPads` object to the `playSound` function.\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction handleKeydown(e) {\r\n\tconst key = e.key.toUpperCase()\r\n\tconst triggerKeys = ['Q', 'W', 'E', 'A', 'S', 'D', 'Z', 'X', 'C'];\r\n\tconst index = triggerKeys.indexOf(key);\r\n    if (index > -1) {\r\n      playSound(drumPads[index]);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can hit any of the nine trigger keys, and you should hear the corresponding sound, and User Story #6 is now complete.\r\n",

      "text": "---\r\ntitle: Create All Drumpads\r\n---\r\nWe now have an error tellings us `'pad' is not defined`. That's because we're now trying to pass a prop to our `Drumpad` component that doesn't exist. It's an easy fix though. Since we want to create multiple `Drumpads`, we can use Svelte's `{#each}` loop, which will loop through an array and create markup for each item in the array. Inside `App.svelte`, go to the markup, and wrap the `Drumpad` component in with `{#each drumPads as pad}`\r\n\r\n```html\r\n{#each drumPads as pad}\r\n  <Drumpad {pad} {playSound} />\r\n{/each}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will create a `Drumpad` component for each object in the `drumPad` array, then pass the indexed object to the `Drumpad` component. It's also passing a reference to the `playSound` function to each `Drumpad` component.\r\n\r\nThe problem we have now, is no sound is being played. This is because `playSound` is using the variable `const sound = pad.audioElement`. Well, pad is no longer in the scope of playSound. To correct this, let's add `pad` as an argument to `playSound`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\tfunction playSound(pad) {\r\n\t\tconst sound = pad.audioElement;\r\n\t\tsound.currentTime = 0;\r\n\t\tsound.play();\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, we'll have to go into `Drumpad.svelte`, and pass `pad` as an argument. We'll change the button tag to match this.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button\r\n  id={pad.displayText}\r\n  class=\"drum-pad\"\r\n  on:click={()=>playSound(pad)}\r\n>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis creates an anonymous function that `on:click` calls, which in turn calls `playSound` with the `pad` argument passed.\r\n\r\nNow, click on the various buttons, and you'll find things sound great again.",

      "text": "---\r\ntitle: Refining Drumpad Component\r\n---\r\nNow that we have a functional component, let's refine it to match some of the criteria required in our User Story.\r\n\r\n**User Story #3:** Within #drum-machine I can see 9 clickable drum pad elements, each with a class name of drum-pad, a unique id that describes the audio clip the drum pad will be set up to trigger, and an inner text that corresponds to one of the following keys on the keyboard: Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C. The drum pads MUST be in this order.\r\n\r\n**User Story #4:** Within each .drum-pad, there should be an HTML5 audio element which has a src attribute pointing to an audio clip, a class name of clip, and an id corresponding to the inner text of its parent .drum-pad (e.g. id=\"Q\", id=\"W\", id=\"E\" etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, let's create an object that we can use to store some info about each drumpad. We'll eventually create an array of these objects, for for now, we'll just create on for this component.\r\n\r\nInside of your `script` tag, create an object called `pad`. Inside the object, we'll also assign the following properties.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet pad = {\r\n  id: \"Q\",\r\n  soundUrl: \"/tutorial/drumkit/sounds/ride.wav\",\r\n  displayText: \"ride\",\r\n  audioElement: undefined,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `id` property be the inner text of the `button`, as well as the id of each `audio` element\r\n\r\nThe `soundUrl` will be the `src` attribute of the `audio` element.\r\n\r\n`displayText` will be the `id` of each button, and the text that is displayed when each audio clip is played.\r\n\r\n`audioElement` will hold the reference to each audio element, removing the need for the `sound` variable.\r\n\r\nNow that we have a data structure, let's update our HTML.\r\n\r\nFirst, let's give our `button` an 'id' equal to `pad.displayText` and a `class` of `\"drum-pad\"`. We'll also changer the `button` inner text to `pad.id`. This should have us set up to complete User Story #3.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button \r\n  id={pad.displayText}\r\n  class=\"drum-pad\"\r\n  on:click={playSound}\r\n>\r\n  <audio\r\n    bind:this={sound}\r\n    src=\"tutorial\\drumkit\\sounds\\ride.wav\"\r\n  />\r\n  {pad.id}\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's also add an `id` and `class` to our `audio` element. The `id` will be equal `pad.id` and we can set the `class` equal `\"clip\"`. Now we're setup to complete User Story #4.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<audio\r\n  id={pad.id}\r\n  class=\"clip\"\r\n  bind:this={sound}\r\n  src=\"tutorial\\drumkit\\sounds\\ride.wav\"\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can change `bind:this` from `sound` to `pad.audioElement`. We'll also change the `src` to `pad.soundUrl`. \r\n\r\n```html\r\n  <audio \r\n    id={pad.id}\r\n    class=\"clip\"\r\n    bind:this={pad.audioElement} \r\n    src=\"tutorial\\drumkit\\sounds\\ride.wav\" \r\n  />\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd to set us up for future styling, let's wrap all of this up in a `div`. \r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div>\r\n  <button\r\n    id={pad.displayText}\r\n    class=\"drum-pad\"\r\n    on:click={playSound}\r\n  >\r\n    <audio\r\n      bind:this={pad.audioElement}\r\n      id={pad.id}\r\n      class=\"clip\"\r\n      src={pad.soundUrl}\r\n    />\r\n    {pad.id}\r\n  </button>\r\n  <p>{pad.displayText}</p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince, we are now binding the audio element to pad.audioElement, we can delete the `let sound` declaration. When we do this, the `playSound` function won't work anymore, so we'll have to modify that a little bit by creating `const sound = pad.audioElement` inside of the `playSound` function.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  let pad = {\r\n      id: 'Q', \r\n      soundUrl: 'tutorial/drumkit/sounds/ride.wav', \r\n      displayText: 'ride', \r\n      audioElement: undefined,\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  function playSound() {\r\n    const sound = pad.audioElement\r\n    sound.currentTime = 0;\r\n    sound.play();\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur final code should look like this, and we are setup to turn this into a stand alone component.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  let pad = {\r\n      id: 'Q', \r\n      soundUrl: 'tutorial/drumkit/sounds/ride.wav', \r\n      displayText: 'ride', \r\n      audioElement: undefined,\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  function playSound() {\r\n    sound.currentTime = 0;\r\n    sound.play();\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n  <button\r\n    id={pad.displayText}\r\n    class=\"drum-pad\"\r\n    on:click={playSound}\r\n  >\r\n    <audio\r\n      bind:this={pad.audioElement}\r\n      id={pad.id}\r\n      class=\"clip\"\r\n      src={pad.soundUrl}\r\n    />\r\n    {pad.id}\r\n  </button>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "text": "---\r\ntitle: Initial Drumpad Component\r\n---\r\nOkay, let's start off by building a super simple component that will only play one sound. Eventually, we'll use this as a template to play all of the sounds.\r\n\r\nInside of `App.svelte`, create a `script` tag.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBelow the `script` tag, create an html button element, and give it a text of \"button\".\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script></script>\r\n\r\n<button>\r\n  button\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'll also create an `audio` element with it's `src` linked to one of the sound files we're hosting. Learning Svelte has some sound files in it's static directory that we'll be using, but you can use whatever sounds you're able to provide a `src` link to. \r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button on:click={playSound}>\r\n  <audio \r\n    bind:this={sound} \r\n    src=\"tutorial\\drumkit\\sounds\\ride.wav\"\r\n  /> \r\n  button\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'll also want a way to reference the `audio` tag. For this, we're going to use a Svelte binding, and bind it to a variable we declare in the `script` tag.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  let sound;\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<button on:click={playSound}>\r\n  <audio \r\n    bind:this={sound} \r\n    src=\"tutorial\\drumkit\\sounds\\ride.wav\"\r\n  /> \r\n  button\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat this is doing is creating an `undefined` `sound` variable, and when the `audio` element is created, creating a reference to the `audio` element via the `sound` variable.\r\n\r\nNext, we'll want something to happen when we click the button. We'll create a `click` event handler on our button to call a function when our button is clicked.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button on:click={playSound}>\r\n  button\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSvelte has several event handlers, which are called by using `on:` followed by the event handler. For this instance, we're using `click`, which will call the `playSound` function. Next, we'll define the playSound function to remove the `playsound is not defined` error. Inside the script tag, create a `playSound` function that `console.log`'s the `sound` variable.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  let sound;\r\n  function playSound() {\r\n    console.log(sound);\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, when you click the `button`, the `sound` variable will display in the console. It's too big for the built in console, so you'll have open your inspector by pressing 'F12', then clicking the console tab. You'll notice the `sound` variable is indeed referencing the `audio` tag.\r\n\r\nHowever, we want to hear this thing, not see, it. Since sound is referencing an `audio` element, we have some methods open up to us. Notably, the `play` method. Inside of `playSound`, remove the `console.log`, and add `sound.play()`.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  let sound;\r\n  function playSound() {\r\n    sound.play();\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nClick the button, and it plays the sound. Cool. There's a problem though. If you hit the button multiple times, the audio plays all the way to the end before it replays. That's not exactly how a drum works, so we want the audio to replay from the beginning each time we hit the button. We can easily accomplish this by setting the audio's `currentTime` to zero each time the button is clicked.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  let sound;\r\n  function playSound() {\r\n    sound.currentTime = 0;\r\n    sound.play();\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOkay, so the completed code should look like this.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  let sound;\r\n\r\n  function playSound() {\r\n    sound.currentTime = 0;\r\n    sound.play();\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<button on:click={playSound}>\r\n  <audio \r\n    bind:this={sound} \r\n    src=\"tutorial\\drumkit\\sounds\\ride.wav\"\r\n  /> \r\n  button\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n",

      "text": "---\r\ntitle: Horizontal/Vertical Split Screen\r\n---\r\nThis layout works for a narrow screen, but for a wider screen, it would be nice if the screen split horizontally instead of vertically. Since we used a Svelte action, we can make that happen.  First though, we'll need to know how wide the screen is so we can determine whether to split it horizontally or vertically. So, we'll create a variable to hold the container width.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nonMount(handleInput);\r\n\r\nlet htmlContent;\r\nlet containerWidth;\r\n\r\nfunction handleInput()...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, we can bind the dimension of an element to `containerWidth`. We care about the `s-panel-container`, to we'll bind it's width using Svelte's `bind:clientWdith`. If we put `{clientWidth}` in our markup, we can see it dynamically update as we change the REPL preview panel. \r\n\r\nInside of the markup, change it to look like this.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n{containerWidth}\r\n<s-panel-container\r\n  bind:clientWidth={containerWidth}\r\n  use:splitPane\r\n>\r\n  <textarea...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow that we know we can track the container width, let's remove `{containerWidth}` from the markup. \r\n\r\nWith the `containerWidth` variable updating as we resize the container, we can use that to create a CSS variable to change `s-panel-container`'s `flex-direction` base on the width of the screen. We'll add a `style` tag to `s-panel-container` and use it to create an `orientation` variable.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n{containerWidth}\r\n<s-panel-container  \r\n  style=\"--orientation: {containerWidth > 600 ? 'row' : 'column'}\"\r\n  bind:clientWidth={containerWidth}\r\n  use:splitPane\r\n>\r\n  <textarea...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, if the `containerWidth` is greater than 600, then the `orientation` will be `row`, otherwise, it will be column. With that, let's change the `flex-direction` in the `s-panel-container` style to `var(--orientation)`. \r\n\r\n```css\r\ns-panel-container {\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n    height: 100%;\r\n    border: 1px solid black;\r\n    flex-direction: var(--orientation);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, when we resize the preview panel, the panels will change how they're split. However, we have a new problem. When the screen is wider than 600, the gutter resizes when the mouse is moved up/down rather than left/right. That's because Split.js is initialized with a `direction` of `vertical`. We need a way to rerun the `Split` function whenever the orientation changes, as well as a way to change the `direction` option for `Split`. \r\n\r\nSvelte actions allow us to re-run `Split` by returning an update function. Inside of the `splitPane`function, below the `Split` function, add the new `return {update(){}}` function. Also, change the value of `direction` from `\"vertical\"` to `splitDirection`. \r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction splitPane() {\r\n      Split(['#editor', '#preview'], {\r\n        direction: splitDirection,\r\n        elementStyle: (dimension, size, gutterSize) => ({\r\n          'flex-basis': `calc(${size}% - ${gutterSize}px)`,\r\n        }),\r\n        gutterStyle: (dimension, gutterSize) => ({\r\n          'flex-basis': `${gutterSize}px`,\r\n          background: 'gray',\r\n          border: 'solid white',\r\n          'border-width': '5px 5px',\r\n        }),\r\n        gutterSize: 2,\r\n      });    \r\n\r\n    return {\r\n      update() {       \r\n      },\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n`update` is the function that will run whenever the Svelte action is updated. It's inside here that we can write some code to re-run `Split`.\r\n\r\nRight now though, we have an error saying `splitDirection is not defined` so let's correct that. We want `splitDirection` to be either vertical or horizontal, so we'll declare a reactive variable that monitors `containerWidth` and updates accordingly.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nonMount(handleInput);\r\n\r\nlet htmlContent;\r\nlet containerWidth;\r\n$: splitDirection = containerWidth > 600 ? 'horizontal' : 'vertical' \r\n\r\nfunction handleInput()...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nSince we want to re-run `Split`, let's wrap the 'Split' function in another function, then call that function when `splitPane` is called. We'll also call the function whenever the Svelte action is updated by putting it inside the `update` function.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction splitPane() {\r\n  function split() {\r\n    Split(['#editor', '#preview'], {\r\n      direction: containerWidth > 600 ? 'horizontal' : 'vertical',\r\n      elementStyle: (dimension, size, gutterSize) => ({\r\n        'flex-basis': `calc(${size}% - ${gutterSize}px)`,\r\n      }),\r\n      gutterStyle: (dimension, gutterSize) => ({\r\n        'flex-basis': `${gutterSize}px`,\r\n        background: 'gray',\r\n        border: 'solid white',\r\n        'border-width': '5px 5px',\r\n      }),\r\n      gutterSize: 2,\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  split() //notice how this calls the function we just wrapped\r\n\r\n  return \r\n    update() {\r\n      split() //and this will get called whenever update is called.\r\n    },\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll need a way for the Svelte action to recognize an update. To do that, we just set it equal to a variable we want it to monitor. Whenever the value of the variable changes, the `update` function will be called, which in our case will then call the `split` function, which in turn re-runs `Split`. Down in the markup, inside `s-panel-container` change `use:splitPane` to `use:splitPane={splitDirection}`. Now, whenever `splitDirection` changes value, `splitPane` will call it's `update` function. \r\n\r\nHowever, we now have another problem. It's like Biggie says \"Mo' coding, Mo' problems\". Whenever we resize our preview window and containerWidth jumps between the 600px threshold, another gutter is being created, then another gutter, then another... We need a way to destroy the previous gutter whenever we create a new gutter. \r\n\r\nReading through the [Split.js docs](https://github.com/nathancahill/split/tree/master/packages/splitjs#api), there appears to be a way to destroy an instance of Split. Let's try that. It looks like we need to save the instance to a variable, then call `destroy` on that instance. Let's create a new variable called `splitInstance`\r\n\r\n```js\r\nonMount(handleInput);\r\n\r\nlet htmlContent;\r\nlet containerWidth;\r\n$: splitDirection = containerWidth > 600 ? 'horizontal' : 'vertical';\r\nlet splitInstance;\r\n\r\nfunction handleInput()...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, inside of our `split` function that's inside of the `splitPane` function, let's set `splitInstance = Split([], ...)` like the docs show us. Now, in our `update` function, we should be able to call `splitInstance.destroy()` prior to calling `split` which will destroy the previous gutter before creating the new one. \r\n\r\n```js\r\n...\r\n  return {\r\n    update() {\r\n      splitInstance.destroy();\r\n      split();\r\n    },\r\n  };\r\n```\r\n\r\nCool. Everything is working as expected with the new functionality. \r\n\r\nNext, let's add the ability to upload a markdown file and have it preview the HTML.",

      "text": "---\r\ntitle: Split Screen Styling\r\n---\r\nFirst, let's shorten up that `markdownContent`, and get rid of the `<svelte:head>`\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  import { onMount } from 'svelte';\r\n  import marked from 'marked';\r\n  marked.setOptions({\r\n    breaks: true,\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  onMount(handleInput);\r\n\r\n  function handleInput() {\r\n    htmlContent.innerHTML = marked(markdownContent);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  let htmlContent;\r\n\r\n  let markdownContent = `# Learning Svelte is so cool!\r\n\r\n## Markdown is pretty cool too!`\r\n\r\n<textarea\r\n  id=\"editor\"\r\n  on:keyup={handleInput}\r\n  bind:value={markdownContent}\r\n/>\r\n<div id=\"preview\" bind:this={htmlContent} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, to help with our styling, we're going to use a library called [Split.js](https://split.js.org/).\r\n\r\nSo, let's go ahead and import that.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  import { onMount } from 'svelte';\r\n  import Split from 'split.js';\r\n  import marked from 'marked';\r\n  marked.setOptions({\r\n    breaks: true,\r\n  });\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, we're going to create a function for using a [Svelte action](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/actions). An action is basically a function that gets called whenever an element is created. It's kind of like using `onMount`, but is attached to a specific element by using the `use:function` directive. [Svelte.school](https://svelte.school/tutorials/introduction-to-actions) has a pretty good tutorial on actions, and I highly recommend checking it out. The action we're going to be creating is what will implement the `Split.js` library when our component is created. \r\n\r\nSo, right below the `handleInput` function, we'll create a new function called splitPane\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction handleInput() {\r\n    htmlContent.innerHTML = marked(markdownContent);\r\n  }\r\n\r\nfunction splitPane(node) {\r\n  Split(['#editor', '#preview'], {\r\n    direction: 'vertical',\r\n    elementStyle: (dimension, size, gutterSize) => ({\r\n      'flex-basis': `calc(${size}% - ${gutterSize}px)`,\r\n    }),\r\n    gutterStyle: (dimension, gutterSize) => ({\r\n      'flex-basis': `${gutterSize}px`, \r\n      background: 'gray',\r\n      border: 'solid white',\r\n      'border-width': '5px 5px',    \r\n    }),\r\n    gutterSize: 2,\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet markdownContent = `# Lea...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we have a few things going on here. We created a function that will call the `Split` function. Reading through the [docs of Split.js](https://github.com/nathancahill/split/tree/master/packages/splitjs), I've decided to use the flexbox method. So, the first argument for the `Split` function will be an array of the div's we'll be splitting, and the second will be our options object. Because the preview screen to the right is narrow, I've decided to go with a `vertical` direction. The `elementStyle` is copied straight from the docs, but is a function that will update the inline styling of the two div's passed in the first argument.  The `gutterStyle` is similar to the `elementStyle`, but is used to style the line between the two elements. It takes an object of CSS styles, and will apply them to the gutter. I gave it a border width so it was easier to grab with the mouse, and a gray color. Finally, a `gutterSize` is given which will be used in the `elementStyle` and `gutterStyle` functions.\r\n\r\nNow, we can go down to our markup and wrap our two divs in a new custom element called `s-panel-container`. We're using a custom element instead of a div because it's makes the markup more intuitive, and all of the cool kids are using custom elements. You wanna be cool, don't you???\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<s-panel-container>\r\n  <textarea\r\n    id=\"editor\"\r\n    on:keyup={handleInput}\r\n    bind:value={markdownContent}\r\n  />\r\n  <div id=\"preview\" bind:this={htmlContent} />\r\n</s-panel-container>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, we'll tell `s-panel-container` to `use:splitPane`.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<s-panel-container use:splitPane>\r\n  <textarea\r\n    id=\"editor\"\r\n    on:keyup={handleInput}\r\n    bind:value={markdownContent}\r\n  />\r\n  <div id=\"preview\" bind:this={htmlContent} />\r\n</s-panel-container>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, when `s-panel-container` is created, the `splitPane` function will be called, with `s-panel-container` as the `node` sent to the function.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't appear that anything has happened, but once we style `s-panel-container`, we'll see some magic. So, in our `style` tag, let's add\r\n\r\n```css\r\ns-panel-container {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n  height: 100%;\r\n  border: 1px solid black;\r\n  flex-direction: column;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd BOOM!!! MAGIC!!!\r\n\r\nIf we click on the gutter, we can now resize the two panels. Let's also add a gutter style so the cursor changes when we hover over the gutter. Reading through the Split.js docs, we find we just need to add a class of `.gutter-vertical` to the styles. So, in the style tag, add:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.gutter-vertical {\r\n  cursor: ns-resize;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, this giving an warning about an unused CSS selector. That is because that style get's added programmatically by Split.js, so the Svelte complier isn't seeing it when the component is built. By wrapping the style in a global wrapper, we can remove the warning.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:global(.gutter-vertical) {\r\n  cursor: ns-resize;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, when we hover over the gutter, the cursor changes.",

      "text": "---\r\ntitle: Refactor Code for fCC Tests\r\n---\r\nFirst, let's create an `on:keyup` event handler on the `textarea`.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<textarea id=\"editor\" bind:value={markdownContent} on:keyup={handleInput}/>\r\n<div id=\"preview\">\r\n  {@html htmlContent}\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, inside the script, let's create the `handleInput` function. It's basically going to be a clone of the `$: htmlContent` reactive declaration.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  import marked from 'marked';\r\n  marked.setOptions({\r\n    breaks: true,\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  $: htmlContent = marked(markdownContent);\r\n\r\n  function handleInput() {\r\n    htmlContent = marked(markdownContent);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  let markdownContent = `# Learning Svelte is so cool!...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd since we're now updating `htmlContent` with the `handleInput` function, we can make `htmlContent` a regular `let` variable. Because it references `markdownContent`, we'll have to move it below the `markdownContent` declaration.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  import marked from 'marked';\r\n  marked.setOptions({\r\n    breaks: true,\r\n  });  \r\n\r\n  function handleInput() {\r\n    htmlContent = marked(markdownContent);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  let markdownContent = `# Learning Svelte is so cool!...`\r\n\r\n  let htmlContent = marked(markdownContent);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSweet. Now, run the test again, and... wait for it... wait for it... succ... What!?!... Fail!?!\r\n\r\nHmmm... not cool.\r\n\r\nOkay, so maybe it's something with using the curly braces inside of `#preview` that the Test Suite is having troubles with. Well, we could update it using the `innerHTML` attribute of the element. Let's try that. Let's use the `htmlContent` variable as a place to store a reference to the `#preview` element. We can do that by using Svelte's `bind:this`. Down in our markup, we'll change `#preview` to make this happen.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<textarea id=\"editor\" bind:value={markdownContent} on:keyup={handleInput}/>\r\n<div id=\"preview\" bind:this=\"htmlContent\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd since we change what `htmlContent` is now referencing, we can change it's initial declaration and move it back above that mess we're calling `markdownContent`.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  import marked from 'marked';\r\n  marked.setOptions({\r\n    breaks: true,\r\n  });    \r\n\r\n  function handleInput() {\r\n    htmlContent = marked(markdownContent);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  let htmlContent;\r\n\r\n  let markdownContent = `# Learning Svelte is so cool!...`\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, we'll have to change our `handleInput` function to update the `innerHTML` of `htmlContent`\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  function handleInput() {\r\n    htmlContent.innerHTML = marked(markdownContent);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOk, so now `#preview` is blank. But if we type something into the `textarea`, `#preview` updates. If we run our fCC Test, we're now getting 7/8 passed. Looking at the log for the one that's not passing, we find the markdown is not there on first load. We can use Svelte's `onMount` to remedy this. We'll have to import it first.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  import { onMount } from 'svelte';\r\n  import marked from 'marked';\r\n  marked.setOptions({\r\n    breaks: true,\r\n  });\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n`onMount` is one of Svelte's lifecycle methods. It's a function that takes another function as it's argument. Typically, we would pass an inline function to it. Something like\r\n```js\r\nonMount( ()=>console.log('I run when the component is mounted') )\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, we already have a function that will update the `innerHTML` of `htmlContent`. So, we'll just tell `onMount` to run `handleInput` when this component initially mounts.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  import { onMount } from 'svelte';\r\n  import marked from 'marked';\r\n  marked.setOptions({\r\n    breaks: true,\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  onMount(handleInput);\r\n\r\n  function handleInput() {\r\n    htmlContent.innerHTML = marked(markdownContent);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, let's try our Test. Awesome!!! They all pass. It's a little bit convoluted that work around we had to do to make the test pass, but it's also cool, because Svelte allows us to accomplish the same thing in different ways. I think the original code is better, but for the sake of passing the fCC test, we'll roll with this new code. With the test being passed, all that's left is styling.",

We should be passing the test, but we're failing them. Let's look at the the log of the tests by clicking `Test 5/8`.\r\n\r\nOkay, so it's basically saying as we type, the `#preview` area is not being updated. But, if we type in the `textarea`, `#preview` is updated. It must be the way the test is written, and it's not detecting the changes. Looking a little more at the error, it is looking for the change on `keyup`. Well, I prefer our code to stay as written, but it's not going to work with the Test Suite. Let's refractor our code so we can pass the Test.\r\n\r\n",

Svelte has a built-in way of doing that called `@html`. It can be dangerous to use, because it doesn't sanitize any of the html, so if you're showing user generated inputs, you could be exposed to some cross-site scripting. Since we're the one providing the input from the text editor, we won't sanitize the htmlContent, but it is something to keep in mind when developing your own apps in the future. So, we'll use `@html` to change the preview.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<textarea id=\"editor\" bind:value={markdownContent} />\r\n<div id=\"preview\">{@htmlContent}</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAside from some styling, that's pretty much it. We're meeting all of the User Stories.~\r\n\r\n~**User Story #1**: I can see a `textarea` element with a corresponding `id=\"editor\"`.~\r\n\r\n~**User Story #2**: I can see an element with a corresponding `id=\"preview\"`.~\r\n\r\n~**User Story #3**: When I enter text into the `#editor` element, the `#preview` element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.~\r\n\r\n~**User Story #4**: When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the `#editor` element, the text is rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element as I type.~\r\n\r\n~**User Story #5**: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the `#editor` field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.~\r\n\r\n~**User Story #6**: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the `#editor` field should be rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element.~\r\n\r\n~**Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass)**: My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as `br` (line break) elements.~",

      "text": "---\r\ntitle: Create Initial Script\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is a surprisingly simple project. We're going to use the [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) library, which will do most of the heavy lifting for us. If we were doing this as a stand alone project, using a text editor, we would first need to run `npm install marked --save-dev` in order to install the library in our `node_modules` folder. However, since we're using the Repl, that step is taken care of for us. \r\n\r\nSo, let's start. Inside `App.svelte`, create a `script` tag, and import `marked`. Since we want the extra credit by converting line breaks to `<br>` tags, we'll also set the `breaks` option to `true`.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  import marked from 'marked';\r\n  marked.setOptions({\r\n    breaks: true,\r\n  });\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, we'll set a reactively declared variable, and call it `htmlContent`. Then set the value equal to `marked(markdownContent)`. Now, whenever the variable `markdownConent` is changed, the `marked` function will be called again, and `htmlContent` will be reactively updated.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  import marked from 'marked';\r\n  marked.setOptions({\r\n    breaks: true,\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  $: htmlContent = marked(markdownContent);\r\n  \r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll create a variable that holds our initial `markdownContent` string. We want to make sure the string contains the markdown for a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text. This way we can ensure we complete User Story #5.\r\n\r\n**User Story #5**: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the `#editor` field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  import marked from 'marked';\r\n  marked.setOptions({\r\n    breaks: true,\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  $: htmlContent = marked(markdownContent);\r\n\r\n  let markdownContent = `# Learning Svelte is so cool!\r\n\r\n  ## Markdown is pretty cool too!\r\n  ### And here's some things you can do with Markdown:\r\n    \r\n  You can inline code \\`<p>Svelte is Amazing!!!</p>\\`.\r\n\r\n  Or, do a code block.

      "text": "---\r\ntitle: Randomize Quote\r\ncomponent: App.svelte\r\nfold: [\"style\"]\r\n---\r\nIn order to make this random, we'll just create a new quotes array that shuffles our imported quotes. Then, whenever we get to the end of the shuffled quotes array, we'll just reset our index, and reshuffle the quotes, kind of like a deck of cards. We'll use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fisher & Yates Shuffle</a>. You don't have to know what it is to use it, but if you're curious, just click the link. \r\n\r\nFirst, let's create our `shuffle` function. Below the `newQuote` function add this.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction shuffle(array) {\r\n  let a = [...array];\r\n  for (let i = a.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {\r\n      let j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));\r\n      [a[i], a[j]] = [a[j], a[i]];\r\n  }\r\n  return a;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically, this is cloning the array passed to it, shuffling the clone, then returning the shuffled clone.\r\n\r\nNext, instead of \r\n```js\r\nimport quotes from './quotes.json';\r\n```\r\n\r\nchange it to \r\n```js\r\nimport quoteBank from './quotes.json';\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe just changed the name `quote` to `quoteBank`.\r\n\r\nThen we'll create our quotes variable by calling the `shuffle` function with `quoteBank` as an arugment. Below `import RightPanel from './RightPanel.svelte';` add\r\n`let quotes = shuffle(quoteBank);.`\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport quoteBank from './quotes.json';\r\nimport LeftPanel from './LeftPanel.svelte';\r\nimport RightPanel from './RightPanel.svelte';\r\nlet quotes = shuffle(quoteBank);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, whenever the page is reloaded, the `quotes` array is shuffled. All that's left is reshuffling the array whenever we get to the last quote. Inside of the `newQuote` function, below `index = 0;`, add `quotes = shuffle(quoteBank);`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction newQuote() {\r\n  index++;\r\n  if (index === quotes.length) {\r\n      index = 0;\r\n      quotes = shuffle(quoteBank);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will give us a whole new array with quoteBank reshuffled. \r\n\r\nThat's it. Our App is complete, and we can now enjoy the good life, just as the Stoics intended.",

      "text": "---\r\ntitle: Control Buttons\r\ncomponent: RightPanel.svelte\r\nfold: [\"script\"]\r\n---\r\nWe're just about wrapped up with this one. We just need to style our buttons, and all of the styling will be complete. We'll add some icons to the buttons so they look mo' better. To do that, we'll just do the lazy-man's method, and bring them in from font-awesome. In `RightPanel.svelte`, add a `svelte:head` with a reference to the `font-awesome` CSS file.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<svelte:head>\r\n  <link\r\n    rel=\"stylesheet\"\r\n    id=\"font-awesome-css\"\r\n    href=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.4.0/css/font-awesome.min.css\"\r\n    type=\"text/css\"\r\n    media=\"all\"\r\n  />\r\n</svelte:head>\r\n\r\n<pc-panel>\r\n  <pc-stamp>...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen it's just a matter of replace 'New Quote' with the `fa-share` icon, and 'Tweet Quote' with the `fa-twitter` icon.\r\n\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<pc-control-buttons>\r\n  <button id=\"new-quote\" on:click={newQuote}>\r\n    <i class=\"fa fa-share fa-2x\" aria-hidden=\"true\" />\r\n  </button>\r\n  <a href={twitterUrl} id=\"tweet-quote\">\r\n    <i class=\"fa fa-twitter fa-2x\" aria-hidden=\"true\" />\r\n  </a>\r\n</pc-control-buttons>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor styling consistency, let's move the `button` selector to the bottom of our styles, and rename it to `pc-button-controls > button`. Then, have it `float: right` to push it to the right hand side of the screen. \r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style>\r\n...\r\n  pc-valediction > p:nth-of-type(2) {...}\r\n\r\n  pc-control-buttons > button {\r\n      background-color: transparent;\r\n      border: none;\r\n      cursor: pointer;\r\n      padding: 0;\r\n      margin: 0;\r\n      outline: none;\r\n      float: right;\r\n  }\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll change the color of the twitter icon to black.\r\n\r\n```css\r\npc-control-buttons > button {\r\n  background-color: transparent;\r\n  border: none;\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n  padding: 0;\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n  outline: none;\r\n  float: right;\r\n}\r\n\r\npc-control-buttons > a > i {\r\n  color: black;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy and large, the app is complete. But let's add one more piece of functionality, where the quotes are displayed randomly.",

Next, let's add an actual stamp. We'll just add an `img` of a stamp to the markup. You can use this URL as your `src`.\r\n\r\n`https://res.cloudinary.com/learningsvelte/image/upload/c_thumb,w_60,g_face/v1595559461/learningsvelte/projects/random_quote_machine/Marcus.png`\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<pc-stamp>\r\n  <p>Place Stamp Here</p>  \r\n  <img\r\n    alt=\"Stamp of Marcus Aurelius\"\r\n    src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/learningsvelte/image/upload/c_thumb,w_60,g_face/v1595559461/learningsvelte/projects/random_quote_machine/Marcus.png\"\r\n  />  \r\n</pc-stamp>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow that we have a stamp, we can style it to place it over the stamp box. First, we'll position it using `absolute`. We're going to bring in another `img` of a cancellation mark, so we'll also target just this `img` so we can move it around some, then we'll rotate it slightly to make it look more natural.\r\n\r\n```css\r\npc-stamp > img {\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n}\r\n\r\npc-stamp > img:nth-of-type(1) {\r\n  top: -5px;\r\n  transform: rotate(3deg);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, we'll add the cancellation mark. The URL for that `img` is\r\n\r\n`https://res.cloudinary.com/learningsvelte/image/upload/v1595561153/learningsvelte/projects/random_quote_machine/cancel.png`\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<pc-stamp>\r\n  <p>Place Stamp Here</p>\r\n  <img\r\n    alt=\"Stamp of Marcus Aurelius\"\r\n    src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/learningsvelte/image/upload/c_thumb,w_60,g_face/v1595559461/learningsvelte/projects/random_quote_machine/Marcus.png\"\r\n  />\r\n  <img\r\n    alt=\"Stamp Cancelation Mark\"\r\n    src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/learningsvelte/image/upload/v1595561153/learningsvelte/projects/random_quote_machine/cancel.png\"\r\n  />\r\n</pc-stamp>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow it's just a simple matter of applying some more CSS to adjust the location of the cancellation mark.\r\n\r\n```css\r\npc-stamp > img:nth-of-type(2) {\r\n  top: 25px;\r\n  right: 25px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAwesome!!! This is really starting to look like a postcard. Let's move on to styling the salutation.",

      "text": "---\r\ntitle: Style RightPanel.svelte\r\ncomponent: RightPanel.svelte\r\nfold: [\"script\"]\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor this component, we're going to use [custom elements](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/customelements/). [Jordan Brennan](https://dev.to/jfbrennan/custom-html-tags-4788) has an article that explains custom elements as well. I like using them, and they feel natural in Svelte where we have components anyway. \r\n\r\nWe could break each of our custom elements into a separate component, which in many case makes sense. However, for this tutorial, we would need four separate components for the `RightPanel`, and with the REPL setup the way it is, it can get a little cumbersome. If I was doing this in VSCode, I would definitely consider putting everything in a folder titled `RightPanel` and creating four separate components. \r\n\r\nBecause this is suppose to look like a postcard, we'll have a stamp, a salutation, a valediction, and footer type thing for the control buttons.\r\n\r\nSo, inside of `RightPanel.svelte`, we're going to change the markup to look like this.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<pc-panel>\r\n  <pc-stamp></pc-stamp>\r\n  <pc-salutation></pc-salutation>\r\n  <pc-valediction>\r\n    <p id=\"author\">{currentAuthor}</p>\r\n  </pc-valediction>\r\n  <pc-control-buttons>\r\n    <button id=\"new-quote\" on:click={newQuote}>New Quote</button>\r\n    <a id=\"tweet-quote\" href={twitterUrl}>Tweet Quote</a>\r\n  </pc-control-buttons>\r\n</pc-panel>\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of using a bunch of `div` tags with classes, we can just create our own elements, and our html becomes a little bit more clear of what is going on. I've prefaced each of my elements with `pc`, which is short for postcard, because a lot of what I've read recommends doing that. If one of our custom elements becomes a standard element, the code may break in a future browser, so the prefix is to help mitigate that. \r\n\r\nThe right panel still looks the same, but now we're using custom elements. \r\n\r\nFirst, let's style the panel some. This is all pretty standard CSS.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style>\r\n   pc-panel {\r\n    box-sizing: border-box;\r\n    width: 50%;\r\n    height: 100%;\r\n    padding: 0 0 0 1em;\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    flex-direction: column;\r\n  }\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'll then tell each of the other custom items where to fall inside `pc-panel` using `flex`.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n  pc-stamp {\r\n    flex: 0 1 auto\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  pc-salutation {\r\n    flex: 0 1 30%;\r\n  }\r\n  pc-valediction {\r\n    flex: 1 1 30%;\r\n  }\r\n  pc-control-buttons {\r\n    flex: 0 1 auto;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll change the style of the `New Quote` button to prevent it from overflowing the postcard. Again, it's pretty basic CSS to reset the button styles. We'll refined the button later, but for now let's add this.\r\n\r\n```css\r\nbutton {\r\n  background-color: transparent;\r\n  border: none;\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n  padding: 0;\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n  outline: none;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",

      "text": "---\r\ntitle: Style LeftPanel.svelte\r\ncomponent: LeftPanel.svelte\r\n---\r\n\r\nNow we can start styling some more. In `LeftPanel.svelte`, below the `script` tag, we'll add a `style` tag. Inside of the style tag, we'll add the following CSS.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style>\r\n  div {\r\n    box-sizing: border-box;\r\n    width: 50%;\r\n    border-right: 1px solid black;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  p {\r\n    margin: 0;\r\n    font-size: 1.2em;\r\n    line-height: 1.2em;\r\n    padding: 0.5rem 1rem 0 1rem;\r\n    transform: rotate(-3deg);\r\n    font-family: 'La Belle Aurore';\r\n  }\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is pretty basic CSS stuff. The width of the `div` is set to `50%` so now the postcard is split in half. A `border-right` is added to visually split the two panels, and make the box look more like a postcard. The `margins` of the `p` are reset to `0`, and we increase the `font-size` and `line-height` to make it a little more readable. We rotate the `p` a little to make it look a little more organic, and add the `font-family`, which uses the Google Font we put in out `svelte:head` in one of the previous steps. Now the left pane has a hand written feel to it. If you click New Quote a few times though, you'll notice a new problem though. If the quote is particularly long, it overflows beyond the postcard. That's not cool. We don't want to have scrollbars in our postcard, so we'll have to decrease the font size if the quote is too long. We'll add a new class to the CSS, which displays a smaller text.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style>\r\n  div {\r\n    box-sizing: border-box;\r\n    width: 50%;\r\n    border-right: 1px solid black;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  p {\r\n    margin: 0;\r\n    font-size: 1.2em;\r\n    line-height: 1.2em;\r\n    padding: 0.5rem 1rem 0 1rem;\r\n    transform: rotate(-3deg);\r\n    font-family: 'La Belle Aurore';\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .small-text {\r\n    font-size: 1em;\r\n  }\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we just need a way for our app to apply the class if the quote is too long. Svelte provides a solution. It's called the `class directive` and it's a way to apply a class to a element if a condition is true. `class:active=\"{current === 'foo'}\"` In this case, the class of `active` will be applied to the element if `current === 'foo'` otherwise, the class is not on the element. We want the `small-text` class to be applied to our `p` if the `currentText.length` is too long. Messing around with the different long quotes, I found `currentText.length > 250` accomplished this.\r\n\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div>\r\n  <p id=\"text\" class:small-text={currentText.length > 250}>\r\n    {currentText}\r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, when we click through the quotes, there's no overflow, and longer quotes have a smaller font. The left panel is working exactly as we'd like it to.",

We'll have the `#text` in the left panel, and everything else in the right panel.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"container\">\t\r\n  <div id=\"quote-box\">\r\n    <div class=\"left-panel\">\r\n      <p id=\"text\">{currentText}</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"right-panel\">\r\n      <p id=\"author\">{currentAuthor}</p>\r\n      <button id=\"new-quote\" on:click={newQuote}>New Quote</button>\r\n      <a id=\"tweet-quote\" href={twitterUrl}>Tweet Quote</a>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\t\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith that done, we can change the display of the `#quote-box` to `flex`, and change the `flex-direction` to `row`. That will split our two panes horizontally.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n  #quote-box {\r\n    box-sizing: border-box;\r\n    width: 500px;\r\n    height: 350px;\r\n    background-color: white;\r\n    padding: 12px;\r\n    box-shadow: 4px 4px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5),\r\n      0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    flex-direction: row;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat sort of give us what we want, but it looks wonky. Before we do any more styling though, let's break the two panels into two separate components. We could do all of the styling inside of `App.svelte`, but I tend to prefer breaking each part into a smaller component to make styling of each component easier. Hit the `+` button on the Repl to create a component. We'll name one `LeftPanel.svelte` and the other `RightPanel.svelte`.\r\n\r\nWe're just going to cut and paste each panel div from `App.svelte` into it's respective component. But, since we removed the markup in `App.svelte` into a component, we'll have to replace that markup with the component.\r\n\r\nSo, the markup for each component will look like this.\r\n\r\n`App.svelte`\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n  <div id=\"quote-box\">\r\n    <LeftPanel />\r\n    <RightPanel />\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n`LeftPanel.svelte`\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"left-panel\">\r\n  <p id=\"text\">{currentText}</p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n`LeftPanel.svelte`\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"right-panel\">\r\n  <p id=\"author\">{currentAuthor}</p>\r\n  <button id=\"new-quote\" on:click={newQuote}>New Quote</button>\r\n  <a id=\"tweet-quote\" href={twitterUrl}>Tweet Quote</a>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, we have all sorts of errors. First, let's define each of our components in `App.svelte`. This will import the component into `App.svelte` which allows us to use the component in our markup.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  import quotes from './quotes.json';\r\n  import LeftPanel from './LeftPanel.svelte';\r\n  import RightPanel from './RightPanel.svelte';\r\n  let index = 0;\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we have a bunch of props that aren't defined. Let's pass those props to our components.\r\n\r\nIn `App.svelte` change the markup to look like this.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n  <div id=\"quote-box\">\r\n    <LeftPanel {currentText} />\r\n    <RightPanel {currentAuthor} {twitterUrl} {newQuote} />\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will pass each of the variables referenced to the component as a prop.\r\n\r\nBut, we still have errors. That's because inside of each component, we need to declare each of the props. We do that with the `export` keyword, which is kind of different, but you'll get use to it. `export` is Svelte's way of telling the component the variable will be receive prop data.\r\n\r\n`LeftPanel.svelte`\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  export let currentText;\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"left-panel\">\r\n  <p id=\"text\">{currentText}</p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n`RightPanel.svelte`\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  export let currentAuthor;\r\n  export let newQuote;\r\n  export let twitterUrl;\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"right-panel\">\r\n  <p id=\"author\">{currentAuthor}</p>\r\n  <button id=\"new-quote\" on:click={newQuote}>New Quote</button>\r\n  <a id=\"tweet-quote\" href={twitterUrl}>Tweet Quote</a>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we're back to where we started, but now with two components, which will make styling easier, since Svelte will scope our css for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.\r\n\r\nNow it's time to start styling this. \r\n\r\nTo start, let's wrap the `#qoute-box` div inside another div and give that div a class of `container`.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"container\">\t\r\n  <div id=\"quote-box\">\r\n    <p id=\"text\">{currentText}</p>\r\n    <p id=\"author\">{currentAuthor}</p>\r\n    <button id=\"new-quote\" on:click={newQuote}>New Quote</button>\r\n    <a id=\"tweet-quote\" href={twitterUrl}>Tweet Quote</a>\r\n  </div>\t\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we can add a `style` tag after our closing `script` tag. Inside of the style tag, let's create some styling for our container.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style>\r\n.container {\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n  height: 100%;\r\n  display: grid;\r\n  place-items: center center;\r\n  background-color: rgba(96, 149, 159, 0.4);\r\n  }\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe're just setting the `height` and `width` to take up all of the available space, then doing a `display` of `grid` which will allow us to use the `place-items` style. Setting `place-items` to `center center`, automatically centers everything inside of .container for us. Super simple. We also added a nice background color to make things a little prettier.\r\n\r\nNext, we'll style the `#quote-box` some, just to make it stand out some more.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style>\r\n.container {\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n  height: 100%;\r\n  display: grid;\r\n  place-items: center center;\r\n  background-color: rgba(96, 149, 159, 0.4);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  #quote-box {\r\n    box-sizing: border-box;\r\n    width: 500px;\r\n    height: 350px;\r\n    background-color: white;\r\n    padding: 12px;\r\n    box-shadow: 4px 4px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5),\r\n      0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);\r\n  }\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe set the `box-sizing` to `border-box` in order to make sure everything stays inside of our defined `width` and `height`. I find `border-box` to be a little more intuitive than the default of `content-box`.\r\n\r\nNext, we set the `width` and `height`. Eventually, the styling will make this look like a postcard, so we're just setting hard values instead of more responsive values. We set the `background-color` to `white` to set it a part from the `.container`, and give it some padding to move the text away from the edges. Finally, we create a little `box-shadow` to make it look like it's hovering slightly over the \r\n`.container`.\r\n\r\nEverything actually looks pretty good. There's some more styling we can do to polish it up, but that's just lipstick and rouge. Let's test the functionality of everything to see where we stand in relation to our User Stories.\r\n\r\nIn the markup, add a `<svelte:head>` tag, with a reference to the `fCC Test Suite.`\r\n\r\n``` html\r\n<svelte:head>\r\n  <script\r\n    src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js\">\r\n\r\n  </script>\r\n</svelte:head>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\t\r\n  <div id=\"quote-box\">\r\n    <p id=\"text\">{currentText}</p>\r\n    <p id=\"author\">{currentAuthor}</p>\r\n    <button id=\"new-quote\" on:click={newQuote}>New Quote</button>\r\n    <a id=\"tweet-quote\" href={twitterUrl}>Tweet Quote</a>\r\n  </div>\t\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n`<svelte:head>` is Svelte's way to tell the compiler to add some stuff to the head tag. Any thing you put in there will be inserted into the head tag, which is nice, because each page or component can have something in the head that is reactively added or removed based the needs of your app. In this case, we're inserting that link to `fCC Test Suite` so we can test our `Random Quote Machine`. Click on the hamburger menu, then select `Random Quote Machine` and run the test. You'll probably get a fail, with `Tests 11/12`. If that's the case, expand the panel with your `quote-box` so the panel is larger than the `quote-box`, then run the test again. Now you should get `Tests 12/12`. With the `.container` smaller than the `quote-box` User Story #11 was failing, so we just needed to expand the `.container`.\r\n\r\nSince we just passed all of the test, technically, this project is complete. But let's go above and beyond and do a little bit more styling to make it really interesting.",

The tweet quote should look something like this...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"This is a super awesome quote.\" -Somebody Cool\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to put that in a url, we'll have to escape any of the following characters: `, / ? : @ & = + $ #`. That's pretty easy to do with our handy-dandy built-in encodeURIComponent function. Let's create a new reactive variable that updates whenever the quote text and author changes.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  import quotes from './quotes.json';\r\n  let index = 0;\r\n  $: currentText = quotes[index].text;\r\n  $: currentAuthor = quotes[index].author;\r\n  $: encodedTweet = encodeURIComponent(\r\n    `\"${currentText}\"  -${currentAuthor}`\r\n  );\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe're just building a string using string literals, which allow us to use the value of a variable as long as it's in a `${}` wrapper, which is not to be confused with Svelte's reactive declaration, which is preceded by `$:`. \r\n\r\nNow that we have our message encoded, we can create our url, again, using a reactive declaration and a string literal.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  import quotes from './quotes.json';\r\n  let index = 0;\r\n  $: currentText = quotes[index].text;\r\n  $: currentAuthor = quotes[index].author;\r\n  $: encodedTweet = encodeURIComponent(\r\n    `\"${currentText}\"  -${currentAuthor}`\r\n  );\r\n  $: twitterUrl = `https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?hashtags=quotes&related=freecodecamp&text=${encodedTweet}`;\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we just need to use the `twitterUrl` in our Twitter `anchor tag` as the `href`.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"quote-box\">\r\n  <p id=\"text\">{currentText}</p>\r\n  <p id=\"author\">{currentAuthor}</p>\r\n  <button id=\"new-quote\" on:click={newQuote}>New Quote</button>\r\n  <a id=\"tweet-quote\" href={twitterUrl}>Tweet Quote</a>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, if you click on the `Tweet Quote` link, the link will take you to Twitter\r\n\r\n",

All we need to do is create a function that increments index whenever the `#new-quote` button is clicked. Because currentText and currentAuthor are reactive, they will update automatically. One little thing to keep in mind, is if we keep incrementing, we can get `index` to be at a higher value than `quotes.length`, so we'll just add some code to our function that resets `index` to zero whenever it reaches the end of the quotes.\r\n\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  import quotes from './quotes.json';\r\n  let index = 0;\r\n  let currentText = '';\r\n  let currentAuthor = '';\r\n\r\n  function newQuote() {\r\n    index++;\r\n    if (index === quotes.length) {\r\n      index = 0;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\nNext, we'll need a way to call the `newQuote` function whenever the button is clicked, which we'll do with by attaching the `on:click` DOM event to the `#new-quote` button.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"quote-box\">\r\n  <p id=\"text\">{currentText}</p>\r\n  <p id=\"author\">{currentAuthor}</p>\r\n  <button id=\"new-quote\" on:click={newQuote}>New Quote</button>\r\n  <a id=\"tweet-quote\">Tweet Quote</a>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nNow you can click on the `#new-quote` button, and watch those new quotes come in.\r\n",

      "text": "---\r\ntitle: Import and Display Quotes\r\nfoldLine: 6\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor this particular app, we're going to have the quotes as a separate file. It is possible to get quotes from an API and display them, but for something this small, I prefer to just have the quotes readily available and not require a `fetch` call to get the data. \r\n\r\nThe format of the quotes will be an array, and for each item of the array will be an object with a key of `author` and a key of `text`. The file is already included in the tutorial to save you the trouble of finding and typing your own quotes. \r\n\r\nTo access the file, inside of your script tag add the following:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  import quotes from './quotes.json';\r\n  let index = 0;\r\n  let currentText = '';\r\n  let currentAuthor = '';\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `index` variable was added, because we will be using that to access each of the quote objects. In order to set the `currentText` and `currentAuthor` to one of the quote objects, we're going to change the `let` declaration to a `reactive` declaration. Svelte does this by using `$:` which tells the compiler \"Write code so any time one of the variables referenced changes, update the declared variable.\"\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  import quotes from './quotes.json';\r\n  let index = 0;\r\n  $: currentText = quotes[index].text;\r\n  $: currentAuthor = quotes[index].author;\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\nSince we're using an array of objects to store our data, we just access the `text` key and `author` key of the object found at the current index, and set our `currentText` and `currentAuthor` variable accordingly.\r\n\r\nBy using `$:`, if either the `quotes` array or the `index` varaible changes, the `currentText` and `currentAuthor` variable will be reactively updated. This is one of the beautiful things about Svelte. Reactive updating is super easy and intuitive as soon as you get use to using `$:` to declare your reactive variables.\r\n\r\nYou'll also notice that the quote and author are now displayed in app. Which completes User Stories #6 & #7.\r\n\r\n**User Story #6:** On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with id=\"text\".\r\n\r\n**User Story #7:** On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with id=\"author\".\r\n\r\n",

      "text": "---\r\ntitle: Create Markup\r\n---\r\nAccomplishing these user stories is actually pretty straight forward. The styling for the post card effect is sort of a pain, though. Let's start off by just completing the user stories, then polishing the app. We'll be doing all of this inside of `App.svelte`. \r\n\r\n**User Story #1:** I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding id=\"quote-box\".\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"quote-box\">\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**User Story #2:** Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id=\"text\".\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"quote-box\">\r\n  <p id=\"text\">{currentText}</p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**User Story #3:** Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id=\"author\".\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"quote-box\">\r\n  <p id=\"text\">{currentText}</p>\r\n  <p id=\"author\">{currentAuthor}</p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**User Story #4:** Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id=\"new-quote\".\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"quote-box\">\r\n  <p id=\"text\">{currentText}</p>\r\n  <p id=\"author\">{currentAuthor}</p>\r\n  <button id=\"new-quote\">New Quote</button>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**User Story #5:** Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable a element with a corresponding id=\"tweet-quote\".\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"quote-box\">\r\n  <p id=\"text\">{currentText}</p>\r\n  <p id=\"author\">{currentAuthor}</p>\r\n  <button id=\"new-quote\">New Quote</button>\r\n  <a id=\"tweet-quote\">Tweet Quote</a>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, let's clear those error by creating the `currentText` and `currentAuthor` variables inside of our `script` tag.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  let currentText = '';\r\n  let currentAuthor = '';\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"quote-box\">\r\n  <p id=\"text\">{currentText}</p>\r\n  <p id=\"author\">{currentAuthor}</p>\r\n  <button id=\"new-quote\">New Quote</button>\r\n  <a id=\"tweet-quote\">Tweet Quote</a>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause the `currentText` and `currentAuthor` variables are empty, nothing is displayed, but we're going to fix that in the next step.\r\n\r\nYou may have noticed the `currentText` and `currentAuthor` variables are wrapped in handlebars inside of the markup. That is Svelte's way of telling the compiler to evaluate what is inside the handlebars and inserting it into the markup. The cool thing about is, it doesn't have to be a variable. You could put `{1+2}` inside the markup, and it will display `3`. You could also put a function inside the handle bars, and it will display the return value of the function. So in your `script`, you could have \r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction sayHello(n){\r\n\t\treturn `Hello ${n}`\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand in your markup have\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<p>{sayHello('Bob')}</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand it'll display `Hello Bob` in your document.\r\n\r\n",
